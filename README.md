# ModernX
An MPV OSC script based on [mpv-osc-modern](https://github.com/maoiscat/mpv-osc-modern/) that aims to mirror the functionality of MPV's stock OSC while with a more modern-looking interface.

# How to install

Locate your MPV folder. It is typically located at `\%APPDATA%\mpv\` on Windows and `~/.config/mpv/` on Linux/MacOS. See the [Files section](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#files) in mpv's manual for more info.

Put mordenx.lua into your mpv "\~\~/scripts/" folder. Create the "\~\~/scripts/" folder if you don't already have one and remove any other OSC scripts,
then put `Material-Design-Iconic-Font.ttf` in the "\~\~/fonts" folder.

in mpv.conf:

```
osc = no
border = no # Optional, but recommended
```
`Material-Design-Iconic-Font.ttf` can also be downloaded from [here](https://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/).

# How to config

edit osc.conf in "\~\~/script-opts/" folder, however many options are changed, so refer to the user_opts variable in the script file for details.

# Thumbnails

To enable thumbnails in timeline, install [thumbfast](https://github.com/po5/thumbfast). No other step necessary.

# Buttons

## Seekbar
